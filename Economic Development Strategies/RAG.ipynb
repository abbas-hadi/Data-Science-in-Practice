Since genes and their\\nproducts determine the physical properties of tissues during\\nmorphogenesis (Newman and Comper, 1990), useful compu-\\ntational models of multicellular development must describe, in\\naddition to differential regulation of gene activity, cell behavi-\\nors such as release of diffusible factors, adhesion and motility\\n(Marée and Hogeweg, 2001).\\nCompu Cell, provides such a computational framework.\\nIndependent software modules simulate the interaction of the\\ngene regulatory network with cellular mechanisms; including\\ncoupling between biosynthesis and diffusion of morphogens\\n(molecules released by cells that affect the behavior of other\\ncells during development), cell adhesion, haptotaxis (move-\\nment of cells along a gradient of a molecule deposited on a\\nsubstrate) and chemotaxis (movement of cells along a gradi-\\nent of a chemical diffusing in the extracellular environment).\\nThe three main components of C ompu Cellare the cellular\\nPotts model (CPM) that describes cell and ECM behaviors,\\na Reaction–Diffusion (RD) module that describes diffusible\\nmorphogens and a combined ODE/state model of genetic reg-\\nulatory networks and differentiation.
